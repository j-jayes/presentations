]

.pull-right[

#### Volcano!

Lowers the cost of mobility for families whose homes destroyed. cf. Bengt's trains.

#### Compelling natural experiment

Random assignment. Binary instrument and response. 

Similar to Tancredi's paper on China, but less endogeneity!

Westman Islands are high income area, not dying town.

#### Heterogenous effects of migration

Impact on young vs old - cf. Clara.

### Helps us to disentangle the selection effect from the returns to migration

## What are the findings?

.pull-left[

![](images/more-money.jpg)

Where the outcome is labour income:

**Compliers age [0-25] at time of eruption earn more over their lifetimes**

But their parents are marginally worse off
]

.pull-right[

![](images/more-schooling.jpg)

Where the outcome is schooling:

**Compliers age [0-25] at time of eruption attain more education**

]

---

## What do they mean?

.pull-left[

As the cost of migrating decreases, individuals are freed to take up occupations that are better suited to their skill set. 

If we want to ensure a labour market functions effectively, we should think carefully about how to implement policy in light of this result.

E.g. did the Rehn-Meidner Swedish model effectively encourage the **right people** to migrate internally?

## LATE

Authors estimate the [Local Average Treatment Effect](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/t0118/t0118.pdf) for the compliers - those who were shocked by the instrument into the treatment group

The effect for the general population will be smaller as "compliers in our experiment are a subgroup of the population that is **less well matched** to living in the Westman Islands than the average person living there."

## LATE: Exclusion restriction

.pull-left[

#### Requirement

- Any effect of instrument on outcome must be through the treatment

- The instrument operates through a single known causal channel

]

.pull-left[

#### Is it met?

- House destruction can impact lifetime income & education only through moving away from Westman Islands

- What about the wealth shock?

- What about massive inflation?

- Etc?

]

---
## LATE: Monotonicity assumption

.pull-left[

#### Requirement

- AKA "No defiers assumption"

- We need the absence of anyone who would have left the Westman Islands but who were pushed to stay by the volcano.
]

.pull-left[

#### Is it met?

- Seems totally reasonable.

]

---
## LATE: Existence of a first stage

.pull-left[

#### Requirement

- Significant first-stage of the instrument on treatment

- Empirically testable

- Rule of thumb requires F-stat > 10

]

.pull-left[

#### Is it met?

## Balance tests

```{r, fig.width=4, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/balance-tests.png")
```

---
## Balance tests

.pull-left[
#### Measured differences

- Houses destroyed on average 2 years older (mean of house age is 30)

- The treatment group is somewhat more likely to have been born in the Westman Islands (83% versus 78% for the control
group)

- But can't reject that this is just random noise


]

.pull-left[
#### Unobserved differences?

- Are there any reasonable sorting hypotheses that would make inhabitants of destroyed houses different?

]

---
## Balance tests

Because 

**House-price ~ income and wealth**, 

the authors assume that the shock is as good as randomly assigned.

---

## Estimation results: labour income

--

**Wald Estimator** for income of those younger than 25 at time of eruption:

Formula:

$$ \frac{E[income_i|destroyed_i] - E[income_i|not destroyed_i]}{E[moved_i|destroyed_i] - E[moved_i|not destroyed_i]} $$
Numbers:

$$ \frac{$3,000}{11.4\%} = $26,600 $$

Relative to those whose houses were not destroyed, those who lost their homes had **lower income between 18 and 25** (while at school) before seeing their incomes **rise during the remainder of their labour income earning years**.

## Estimation results: driven by high earners?

.pull-left[
No, trimming the distribution to just between 15th and 85th percentiles reduces the effect, but not substantially.

From an effect size of 83 percent of the control group's income to 60 percent.

**Inflation** was super high at the time - how does this impact getting a cash payout for your house versus keeping an asset that keeps its value?
